# Go Server

This is my **first Go project** — a simple web server built using Go's `net/http` package.

## 📑 Features

- Serves static files
- Handles form submission (Name & Address)
- Custom route for `/hello`

## 🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajanarahul93/go-server.git
cd go-server
````

2️⃣ Run the server:

```bash
go run main.go
```

3️⃣ Open in your browser:

* `http://localhost:8080/` — Static index page
* `http://localhost:8080/form` — Form submission page
* `http://localhost:8080/hello` — Simple hello handler
